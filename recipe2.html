        <h1 class="heading">Chole Bhature</h1>
        <p class="heading">Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish loved for its rich flavors. It consists of spicy
            chickpea curry (chole) served with deep-fried fluffy bread (bhature). The chickpeas are cooked with onions,
            tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Bhature is
            made from refined flour and yogurt, which makes it soft and puffy when fried. This dish is commonly enjoyed
            as a hearty breakfast or lunch and is often accompanied by pickles, onions, and a squeeze of lemon. Its
            combination of spicy, tangy, and savory flavors makes it a favorite comfort food across India.</p>
