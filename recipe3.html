        <h1 class="heading">Dosa</h1>
        <p class="heading">Dosa is a popular South Indian dish known for its thin, crispy texture and savory taste. It
            is a type of fermented pancake made from a batter of rice and urad dal (split black gram). Dosas are
            typically served hot and can be plain or stuffed with fillings such as spiced mashed potatoes (masala dosa).
            They are often accompanied by coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar (a tangy lentil soup). Loved for
            its light and crispy texture, dosa is a versatile dish enjoyed as breakfast, lunch, or a snack across India
            and around the world.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rinse the rice, urad dal, and chana dal separately under running water until water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Soak the rice, urad dal, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds in water separately for 4–6 hours or
                    overnight.</li>
                <li>Drain the water from urad dal and chana dal. Grind them to a smooth, fluffy batter using some water
                    as needed.</li>
                <li>Drain the rice and grind it into a slightly coarse batter using water as needed.</li>
                <li>Mix both batters together in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8–12 hours or overnight, until it
                    rises and becomes slightly bubbly.</li>
                <li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron pan over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil.</li>
                <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it outward in a circular motion to
                    form a thin pancake.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.</li>
                <li>Cook until the bottom turns golden brown and crisp. Flip only if you prefer both sides cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove from the pan and serve hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or sambar.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process for the remaining batter.</li>
            </ul>
